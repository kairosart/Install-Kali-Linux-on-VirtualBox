[Go to the official website](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/) and download the ISO image of Kali Linux. There are multiple 32-bit and 64-bit images. Each image allows you to select one of the graphical user interfaces (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, etc.) during installation. The latest version is available on the main download page. You can also [download older Kali Linux images](https://old.kali.org/kali-images/) if needed.

Let’s download Kali Linux 64-bit v.2023.3 and then go over the installation process. You can download images via HTTP and Torrent protocols. Save the ISO file to a custom folder, for example, _D:\VirtualBox\kali-linux-2023.3-installer-amd64.iso_. You can also verify the SHA256 checksum to make sure that your image is consistent after finishing downloading.
